# Grocery Delivery Platform

## Introduction

Blinkit (formerly Grofers) is an on-demand grocery delivery service that enables users to shop for groceries online and receive deliveries within hours. This repository outlines the system design of Blinkit, including its architecture, components, and scalability considerations.

The system needs to be highly available, scalable, and resilient to handle millions of daily orders and users. This document covers the **microservices architecture**, **database design**, **real-time data processing**, and **failure handling mechanisms**.

## System Overview

The Blinkit platform allows users to:
- Browse grocery products
- Add items to their cart
- Place orders and make payments
- Track deliveries in real-time

The platform consists of several microservices, each handling specific domains such as user management, product inventory, cart management, payment, order processing, and delivery.

---

## Functional Requirements

- **User Registration and Login**: Allow users to create accounts, authenticate, and manage profiles.
- **Product Browsing**: Users can search for and browse products by categories, brands, or search terms.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add and remove products from their cart and view cart details.
- **Order Placement**: Users can place orders, track status, and get notifications.
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment gateways integration for processing transactions.
- **Delivery Scheduling**: Assign deliveries to available drivers and track delivery status.
- **Push Notifications**: Inform users about order status, deliveries, and promotions.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The platform should be able to handle millions of requests per day.
- **Availability**: The system must achieve 99.99% uptime with low latency.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system should be resilient to failures, ensuring uninterrupted service.
- **Security**: User data and payment transactions must be securely handled and compliant with standards.
- **Performance**: The platform should provide fast and responsive user interactions.

---

## High-Level Architecture

The system follows a **microservices architecture** to provide scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance. Each service is responsible for a specific domain of functionality. Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:



- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point to the system, handling routing, load balancing, and API rate limiting.
- **Microservices**: Each service is independent and interacts with other services via APIs or events.
- **Databases**: Uses a combination of **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases for structured and unstructured data.
- **Event-driven Messaging**: Kafka or RabbitMQ is used for communication between services (e.g., when an order is placed, other services are notified).

---

## Component Breakdown

### User Service
- **Responsibilities**: Handles user registration, login, and authentication.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, JWT for authentication, Redis for session management.

### Product Service
- **Responsibilities**: Manages product catalog, categories, search functionality.
- **Technologies**: Spring Boot, Elasticsearch for search functionality, MongoDB for product storage.

### Cart Service
- **Responsibilities**: Manages user shopping cart (add/remove products, calculate totals).
- **Technologies**: Redis for fast in-memory cart data.

### Order Service
- **Responsibilities**: Manages order creation, status updates, and processing.
- **Technologies**: Java with Spring Boot, Kafka for asynchronous event handling.

### Payment Service
- **Responsibilities**: Handles payment processing using third-party providers like Stripe.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Stripe API, OAuth for secure transactions.

### Delivery Service
- **Responsibilities**: Manages delivery scheduling, route optimization, and status tracking.
- **Technologies**: Python, Google Maps API for route optimization.

### Notification Service
- **Responsibilities**: Sends notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications.
- **Technologies**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Twilio, SendGrid.

## Database Design

- **Relational Databases (SQL)**: Used for structured data such as user information, orders, and payments.
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB or DynamoDB for managing products, inventory, and unstructured data.
- **Caching Layer**: Redis or Memcached for storing frequently accessed data like product details and cart data to minimize database load.

---

## Real-Time Data Processing

- **Inventory Updates**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time event-driven updates on inventory changes.
- **Order Tracking**: Use WebSockets or polling for real-time status updates for users on their orders and deliveries.

---

## Event-Driven Architecture

- **Event Producers and Consumers**: Services communicate via events rather than direct API calls, improving scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Message Queue**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous message passing between services.

---

## Scalability and Load Balancing

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services are designed to be stateless, allowing them to scale horizontally.
- **Load Balancing**: Using tools like HAProxy or Nginx to distribute incoming traffic.
- **Auto-scaling**: Implemented via Kubernetes or AWS Auto Scaling to automatically scale services.

---

## Failure Handling and Fault Tolerance

- **Circuit Breaker**: Using patterns like **Hystrix** to prevent cascading failures across services.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Using exponential backoff to handle transient failures.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If one service fails, the system continues to operate with limited functionality.

---

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT for secure and stateless authentication.
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS for secure communication and AES encryption for sensitive data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect the API with rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

---

## Testing and Continuous Integration

- **Unit Testing**: JUnit for Java, Mocha for Node.js to test individual service logic.
- **Integration Testing**: Test service interactions and dependencies.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.

---

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Centralized Logging**: Use the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for aggregating and visualizing logs.
- **Metrics Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system performance and health.

---

## Deployment Strategy

- **Containerization**: All services are containerized using Docker.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes is used for managing containerized microservices.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: To ensure zero-downtime deployments.

---

## Conclusion

The **Blinkit System Design** focuses on a scalable, resilient, and secure architecture to handle the demands of a modern, high-traffic grocery delivery service. By adopting **microservices**, **event-driven architecture**, and cloud-native technologies, the platform can handle millions of users and orders while providing a seamless user experience.
